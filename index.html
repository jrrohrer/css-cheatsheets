    <h1>HTML, CSS, & Javascript Reference Guide</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my project site! I am building out this website as I learn different concepts as a way to both practice new skills and create for myself (and anyone else who wants to use it) a handy reference guide I can keep open in another tab while I'm working on coding projects. I have finished courses on HTML and CSS, so we'll see those sections of this website fill out first, and JavaScript will be added as I work through my courses.</p>
    <p>Use the nav bar at the top of this page to visit each language's section of the page, and then follow links to specific topics from there.</p>
    <p>On the main page for each language, you will find links to various relevant resources.</p>
